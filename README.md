Oberon V4
=========

(aka Linz Oberon)

This was downloaded as a snapshot from the main branch 
at SourceFource on 2021-03-21. I've made a copy here
as many Oberon resources are disappearing on the web.

The following are the steps I used to download and
setup this archive.

1. Import the SourceForge Git repository to GitHub
2. Add this readme and copying file.

Documentation is still on the web (2021-03-21)
