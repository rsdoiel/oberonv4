Oberon V4
=========

(aka Linz Oberon)

This was downloaded as a snapshot from the main branch 
at SourceFource on 2021-03-21. I've made a copy here
as many Oberon resources are disappearing on the web.

The following are the steps I used to download and
setup this archive.

1. Import the SourceForge Git repository to GitHub
2. Add this readme and copying file.

Documentation is still on the web (2022-07-20)

material in the directory JKU was downloaded from 
their [Public Domain Software](JKU-Public-Domain). 

I've added "Oberon V4 for GNU Linux" also found on SourceForge
in its own directory "Oberon V4 for GNU Linux" thanks to the
pointer from Bernhard Treutwein. The new directory is a copy of
the source from the [tar file](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oberon/files/Oberon%20V4%20for%20GNU_Linux/1.7.02/oberon-1.7.02.tar.gz/download)
for version 1.7.02. I've updated the sob shell script per Bernhard
as his version contained a couple fixes (see the Git repository
changes on sob file).
