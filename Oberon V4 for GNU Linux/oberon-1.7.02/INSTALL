Requirements for Oberon for Linux
=================================

o A Linux - System running ELF. glibc2 or higher required.

o XWindow, Release 11

o Your Linux System should have 4 MB of extra Memory available to run properly.

o If you have a Monochrome Monitor only, POPUP - Elems will appear black the 
  first time you start Oberon. Open PopupElems.Mod, Display.Mod and
  BalloonElems.Mod and click on the Version Element < using the middle mouse
  button. A Popup will appear - but it'll be black. Choose the second entry
  from the Popup and the Version element will change from < Color > to 
  < Monochrome >. Recompile it by marking the viewer (F1) and using the
  command Folds.Compile *. Exit and restart oberon.

o For proper support of Pictures a TrueColor or DirectColor XServer is
  recommended.

To install Oberon for Linux
===========================

0. If you habe downloaded a .rpm Version just type 

        rpm -i oberon-<version>.rpm 

   then create a personal oberon working directory

       mkdir $HOME/oberon

   cd into it

       cd $HOME/oberon

   and start oberon by executing the sob - skript

       sob

-------- Everything below this line is for .tar.gz Installation only --------
1. Change to the directory where you want to install oberon to. (/usr/local/ 
   is recommended)

	cd /usr/local

2. Un-tar the oberon-package
	
	tar zxvf oberon-<version>.tar.gz

   This will create a new directory called oberon. If you have old versions
   installed that you want to keep move them into another place before
   extracting.

3.a Extend the X Fontpath

   I have found that in some cases it may be neccessary to re-run mkfontdir
and/or to zip the fonts.
	
	cd /usr/local/oberon/xfonts
	rm fonts.dir
	gzip fonts.dir
	mkfontdir .
	xset +fp /usr/local/oberon/xfonts ; xset fp rehash


3.b Use alternative Fonts (optional)

  If you are unable to install Fonts for your X-Server you can edit the file 
  Text/Font.Map in order to map Oberon font names to standard XWindow font names.
  The file Text/Font.Map provides examples as well as mapping the formerly
  used syntax font to the free Oberon font now used. 
  To check which fonts are installed on your system use xfontsel

4. Install Printer fonts (optional)

  If you want to print files from oberon you have to map printer fonts by
  editing File.Map. In particular you have to give the Oberon font name, the 
  corresponding Postscript font name and the .AFM (Adobe font metric) files for 
  regular, oblique and bold typeface of the Postscript font.
  You can find these .AFM metrics in the ghostscript package. 
  Common directories for .AFM - Files are /usr/lib/ghostscript/fonts and
  /usr/share/ghostscript/fonts/.

5. Set environment

  As of 1.5.01 you no longer have to set OBROOT to run oberon from
  /usr/local/oberon.
  Only if you decided to install oberon to a different locations or want to 
  run multiple versions of oberon you'll have to edit the sob script
  provided with the installation.

6. Multiuser / Multiproject support
 
  This release supports a multiuser / multiproject environment.
  Put the shell-script sob (startup oberon, a bash script) into /usr/local/bin
  or any other place that can be reached by $PATH.
  Furthermore every user can create one or more directories for his personal
  Files. 

7. Start oberon

  To start oberon, change into a oberon working directory (e.g. ~/oberon)
  and execute sob.
  To provide compatibilty with the Startup-Directory (denoted by the dollar -
  sign under Oberon) links are created that point to the Subdirectories under
  $OBROOT.
  If you change $OBROOT be sure to remove that links so they can be
  reestablished correctly.

8. Hints

  Instead of extending the fontpath everytime you start X, you can also modify
  your /etc/XF86Config (when using XFree86). 
  Add /usr/local/oberon<version>/xfonts to the Fonts-section and restart X.

  If you have problems starting oberon (oberon complains about missing fonts)
  check the File Font.Map (try to rename it if Oberon fonts are installed or 
  assure that the used fonts are available)

  You can have a link /usr/local/oberon that points to the directory of your
  latest release so you don't have to change $OBROOT for each new version of
  oberon.
