Requirements for Oberon for Linux
=================================

o A Linux - System running ELF.

o XWindow, Release 11

o Your Linux System should have 4 MB of extra Memory available to run properly.

o If you have a Monochrome Monitor only, POPUP - Elems will appear black the 
  first time you start Oberon. Open PopupElems.Mod, Display.Mod and
  BalloonElems.Mod and click on the Version Element < using the middle mouse
  button. A Popup will appear - but it'll be black. Choose the second entry
  from the Popup and the Version element will change from < Color > to 
  < Monochrome >. Recompile it by marking the viewer (F1) and using the
  command Folds.Compile *. Exit and restart oberon.

o For proper support of Pictures a TrueColor or DirectColor XServer is
  recommended.

To install Oberon for Linux
===========================

1. Change to the directory where you want to install oberon to. (/usr/local/ 
   is recommended)

	cd /usr/local

2. Un-tar the oberon-package
	
	tar zxvf oberon-<version>.tar.gz

   This will create a new directory called oberon-<version>

3.a Extend the X Fontpath
   I have found that in some cases it may be neccessary to re-run mkfontdir
and/or to zip the fonts. So 

	xset +fp /usr/local/oberon/xfonts ; xset fp rehash


5.b Use alternative Fonts (optional)

  If you are unable to install Fonts for your X-Server you can edit the file 
  Font.Map in order to map Oberon font names to standard XWindow font names.
  The file Font.Map.example provides an example that works on most XServers.

6. Install Printer fonts (optional)

  If you want to print files from oberon you have to map printer fonts by
  editing File.Map. In particular you have to give the Oberon font name, the 
  corresponding Postscript font name and the .AFM (Adobe font metric) files for 
  regular, oblique and bold typeface of the Postscript font.
  You can find these .AFM metrics in the ghostscript package. 
  Common directories for .AFM - Files are /usr/lib/ghostscript/fonts and
  /usr/share/ghostscript/fonts/.

6. Set environment

  You have to set the environment variable $OBROOT to the installation 
  directory of Oberon. (e.g. /usr/local/oberon).
  I've put the following into my .cshrch:
  setenv OBROOT /usr/local/oberon
  You do not have to set OBERON explicetly anymore, all subdirectories of 
  $OBROOT, as well as the current working directory are in the search path 
  of oberon.

7. Multiuser / Multiproject support
 
  The latest release actively supports a multiuser / multiproject environment.
  Put the shell-script sob (startup oberon, a bash script) into /usr/local/bin
  or any other place that can be reached by $PATH.
  Each user that wants to use oberon has to set $OBROOT to the place oberon
  has been installed to (e.g. /usr/local/oberon)
  Furthermore every user can create one or more directories for his personal
  Files. 

8. Start oberon

  To start oberon, change into a oberon working directory (e.g. ~/oberon)
  and execute sob.
  To provide compatibilty with the Startup-Directory (denoted by the dollar -
  sign under Oberon) links are created that point to the Subdirectories under
  $OBROOT.

9. Hints

  Instead of extending the fontpath everytime you start X, you can also modify
  your /etc/XF86Config (when using XFree86). 
  Add /usr/local/oberon/xfonts to the Fonts-section and restart X.

  If you have problems starting oberon (oberon complains about missing fonts)
  check the File Font.Map (try to rename it if Oberon fonts are installed or 
  assure that the used fonts are available)
 
 Read Distribution.Text within Oberon for further details.
