The directory holds the contents from 
https://ssw.jku.at/Research/Projects/OberonDownloads.html
as downloaded manually on 2021-03-21 by me. I believe
these to all be in the public domain based on the 
originating webpage. The webpage is also available
in the Internet Archive's Wayback machine at
https://web.archive.org/web/2020*/https://ssw.jku.at/Research/Projects/OberonDownloads.html

Most the files are in the ".Cod" which I believe to be
an format called AsciiCoder. See the [table of
contents](toc.html)
